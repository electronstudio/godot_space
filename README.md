# Godot space shooter tutorial

This was made for my CoderDojo students.  It gives you a simple working game to start and then shows you how to
improve it by adding nodes and code step-by-step.  It is intended to be printed out and taught by a teacher who explains
the code, but if you've coded before you can probably figure it out on your own.
